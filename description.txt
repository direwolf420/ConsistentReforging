This mod improves reforging by making it less random without being too cheaty

1. Adds an "Undo" button so that you can go back to the prefix you accidently skipped while spamming reforge
2. Prevents duplicate rolls of prefixes if they have been rolled before (by default the last 8, configurable)

Notes:
* Undoing costs no money
* "Undo" button is only visible in the vanilla reforge menu. If other mods (such as "AutoReforge") replace it, it will not exist
* (In that case, Feature #2 will still work when reforging)
* The config contains multiple customizations you can do

MOD INCOMPATIBILITIES:
* Calamity Mod: prevents all the features from working
